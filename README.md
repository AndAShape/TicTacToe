# Console Tic Tac Toe

- My aim was to avoid the game engine having a dependency on System.Console.
- I have not had time to create tests for the Game classes.
- I would like to have added the option to begin a new game.
- Text rendering and input / output could be better abstracted to enable plugging in, for example, graphical rendering.
